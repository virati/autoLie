Introduction:

Efforts towards adaptive deep brain stimulation (DBS) are growing but challenged by the nonlinearity of brain circuits. Nonlinear control theory provides useful frameworks for the study and influence of systems like the brain. Control-affine frameworks, in particular, enable focused study of interactions between brain, disease, and DBS using modern analytical tools. Here, we present a control-affine framework for DBS research before introducing a set of analytical tools that can be used to systematically develop control strategies for adaptive DBS.

 

Objective:

The objective of this work is to introduce nonlinear control theory applications in functional neurosurgery and develop a systematic approach to optimizing DBS control using nonlinear analyses.

 

Method:

**A control-affine framework is developed to reframe DBS as a nonlinear control problem and introduce Lie Controllability analyses for whole-brain dynamics through neural recordings and DBS control. Using Lie derivatives in reduced network models of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease and Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD) we quantify the coverage of our neural recordings and our DBS influence in the direction of predefined disease dynamics by studying the rank of our controllability.
**

**Results:**

**Our framework operationalizes the optimal placement of recording and stimulation probes for maximal coverage of symptoms. Lie derivatives are used to quantify the rank of controllability and observability matrices in our reduced network models. An open-source Python library that implements these analyses is made available (autoLie: github.com/virati/autoLie). **



**Conclusion:**

**This work introduces the use of control-affine frameworks in clinical DBS research and provides an open-source Python library called autoLie that implements Lie Controllability analyses. The control-affine framework provides a first step towards adaptive DBS that accounts for nonlinearities in neural dynamics and DBS influence. Moving forward, the application of nonlinear control theory in DBS will enable more efficient and effective design of adaptive control strategies, especially in the context of improving quantitative models of pathophysiology.**

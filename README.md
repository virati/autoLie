# AutoLie

A simple library that adds Lie derivatives and Lie brackets onto the Autograd library.

## Installation
Just point your PythonPath to this library location. If this becomes more of a project then I'll figure out how to get this pip-able.


## Use case

A simple use case is to define two functions $f(x)$ and $h(x)$ where $f$ is a vector-valued function and $h$ is a scalar function. You can than easily find the Lie Derivative of $h$ with respect to $f$ using:

# PyLie

A simple library for doing Lie derivatives and brackets using autograd-compatible functions

## Installation

Do the standard thing. Point yourselves towards the main file "lie_lib.py"

## Required Libraries
We use autograd, numpy, and mayavi to have the whole package running.

## Example
Below is a simple example using two vector-valued functions $f$ and $g$

The vector fields are seen as quivers and the lie-derivative calculated at each point of the meshgrid is seen as spheres/point3d dots.
